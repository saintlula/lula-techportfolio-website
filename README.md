# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my little corner of the web! 
This is my humble attempt at creating a visually appealing, interactive portfolio to showcase my projects and skills.

## Tech Stack
For this project, I chose:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/main/topics/react/react.png" width="20"> **React** for building a dynamic UI

<img src="https://vitejs.dev/logo.svg" width="20"> **Vite** for lightning-fast development and bundling

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/main/topics/css/css.png" width="20"> **Vanilla CSS** for styling

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/main/topics/javascript/javascript.png" width="20"> **JavaScript** for all the logic behind the scenes

## About This Project
This website is meant to be a small, responsive and interactive hub where you can explore some of my projects, check out my tech experience and get a feel for my design and coding style!
